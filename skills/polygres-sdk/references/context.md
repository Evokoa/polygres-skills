# pgContext

For a synced project, use an existing synchronized source table and embedding
column. Do not use a collection mode that creates a target table or column;
write embeddings to the source PostgreSQL database.

## Namespace and boundaries

Use the one synchronous namespace:

```python
context = client.project().context
```

Do not create collection handles, bound operations, an async client, or a
separate management client. Existing `project.graph`, `project.vector`,
`project.text`, and `project.hybrid` methods remain independent.

Context collections never accept legacy pgvector configuration IDs. Treat
`project.vector` as compatibility for previously registered configurations and
use `project.context` for new semantic retrieval setup. Polygres does not
generate source or query embeddings. The application owns the embedding model,
input construction, dimensions, update timing, and protection of any external
embedding credential. One collection can own multiple named vectors over the
same source table. Query embeddings must match the selected vector's dimensions
and metric requirements.

Use `$polygres-cli` for interactive collection setup and operator workflows.
Use SDK collection mutations only when the application deliberately owns
automated provisioning and the caller has the required management authority.

An `existing` Context source may name a compatible `public.vector(n)` column.
Creating the collection then converts that physical column in place to
`pgcontext.vector(n) NOT NULL`; it does not turn a legacy configuration ID into
a collection or use the same-column bridge. Application-owned provisioning
must separately retire any persisted legacy registration before creation and
must present the table-lock and dependent-index impact for approval.

## Capabilities and collection setup

Use Context capabilities rather than general retrieval readiness:

```python
capabilities = project.context.get_capabilities()

if not capabilities.setup:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Context setup unavailable: {capabilities.setup_blocker}")
```

`setup` applies to collection setup. Before retrieval, check the capability for
the exact method the application will call. For example, require `dense_search`
for `search()` and `joint` for `joint()`, and surface the matching blocker:

```python
if not capabilities.dense_search:
    raise RuntimeError(
        f"Context search unavailable: {capabilities.dense_search_blocker}"
    )

if needs_joint_retrieval and not capabilities.joint:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Context Joint unavailable: {capabilities.joint_blocker}")
```

Use the corresponding `count`, `facets`, `grouped_search`, `recall_check`,
`text_hybrid`, `graph_first`, `vector_first`, or `rank_fusion` flag for those
methods. Collection status and verification do not replace feature-specific
capability checks.

The Python SDK performs this check automatically for Context retrieval. Its
first retrieval call fetches and caches capabilities for that project Context
namespace, and later calls validate project-specific limits locally. Calling
`get_capabilities()` explicitly refreshes the cache. Runtime remains the
authoritative enforcement boundary and revalidates every request.
The cache expires after 60 seconds, and unavailable capabilities are refreshed
on the next attempted call.

Discover visible candidates, then preflight the exact collection request before
creating it:

```python
sources = project.context.discover_sources(schema_names=["public"])

source = {
    "mode": "existing",
    "schema_name": "public",
    "table_name": "documents",
    "source_key_column": "id",
}
vector = {
    "column_name": "embedding",
    "dimensions": 768,
    "metric": "cosine",
}

preflight = project.context.preflight(
    "support_docs",
    source=source,
    vector=vector,
    text_column="content",
    result_columns=["title", "url"],
    filter_columns=["tenant_id", "category"],
)

if not preflight.eligible:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Context preflight blocked: {preflight.blockers}")
```

For a pgvector source, inspect blockers specifically for actual `NULL` values,
dimension mismatch, and unsafe index dependencies. A column declared nullable
can pass when every stored vector is populated. Successful creation is atomic:
non-constraint dependent indexes are dropped, the column is converted through
`real[]`, the native type is set `NOT NULL`, and the pgContext collection and
managed index are created in the same database transaction.

Source modes are `existing`, `add_column`, and `new_table`. The latter two can
change database schema and should not be selected implicitly. Preflight is
read-only; successful preflight does not create or reserve a collection.

Create and verify only after blockers and ownership boundaries are accepted:

```python
operation = project.context.create_collection(
    "support_docs",
    source=source,
    vector=vector,
    text_column="content",
    result_columns=["title", "url"],
    filter_columns=["tenant_id", "category"],
    idempotency_key="support-docs-v1",
)
completed = project.context.wait_for_operation(operation)

if completed.collection_id is None:
    raise RuntimeError("Completed collection creation omitted collection_id")

status = project.context.get_collection_status(completed.collection_id)
verification = project.context.verify_collection(completed.collection_id)
if not verification.verified:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Context verification failed: {verification.checks}")
```

An HTTP-successful verification can still report `verified = False`. Inspect
the ordered checks and request ID.

The creation vector becomes the collection's default. Add another vector only
when the same source rows need another embedding model or input representation:

```python
operation = project.context.add_vector(
    completed.collection_id,
    "title_embedding",
    768,
    name="title_semantic",
    mode="existing",
    metric="cosine",
    set_default=True,
    idempotency_key="support-docs-title-vector-v1",
)
project.context.wait_for_operation(operation)
```

`mode` is `existing` or `add_column`. Adding a vector is a durable mutation and
can change database schema. There is no dedicated add-vector preflight method.
For `existing`, inspect the exact source column before mutation. `add_column`
requires the source table to be empty; show the schema and ownership impact
before application-owned automation performs it. Collection responses expose
`vectors` and `default_vector_name`; do not assume collection status describes
every vector index equally.

Change the two independent defaults with their distinct methods:

```python
operation = project.context.update_collection(
    collection_id,
    default_vector_name="title_semantic",
    idempotency_key="support-docs-default-vector-v1",
)
project.context.wait_for_operation(operation.id)

operation = project.context.set_default_collection(
    collection_id,
    idempotency_key="project-default-context-v1",
)
project.context.wait_for_operation(operation.id)
```

## Identity and durable operations

Pass canonical collection UUIDs to administrative collection, filter, point,
and operation methods. Pass a UUID or exact collection name to count, facets,
and ranked retrieval. The project default collection and each collection's
default vector are independent. Do not scan collection pages to resolve names
or infer either default.

Every durable mutation returns immediately and sends one idempotency key. When
the key is omitted, the SDK generates one UUIDv4 and reuses it only for permitted
transport retries within that method invocation. Generated keys are not exposed
for later replay. Pass and persist a caller-owned stable key when recovery must
survive a failed call, a later call, or a process restart.

```python
operation = context.create_collection("support_docs", source=source, vector=vector)
completed = context.wait_for_operation(operation)
collection_response = context.get_collection(completed.collection_id)
collection = collection_response.collection
```

Waiting is explicit, honors server retry guidance, and does not cancel on
timeout. Operation-management methods identify the operation by its operation
UUID, never by a collection UUID. Call `cancel_operation(operation_id)` or
`retry_operation(operation_id)` separately when the application intends that
action. Never read a private operation result payload.

List and get operations to recover state after a process or network failure.
Only failed or cancelled operations are candidates for retry. The server also
enforces its attempt limit and the operation's `retry_until` window, so handle
`CONTEXT_OPERATION_NOT_RETRYABLE`. An accepted retry creates a new operation ID.
Preserve the original ID, replacement ID, collection ID, status, stage, error,
and request ID.

Collection deletion requires `confirm_collection_id` to exactly equal the path
collection UUID. Read the collection as well as its deletion plan first. For
`existing` and `add_column`, deletion preserves the source table and user-owned
data. For a verified owned `new_table` source, deletion drops the managed source
table and its rows. Do not rely on the summarized deletion plan alone; inspect
`source_mode` and `owns_source_table`, and do not hide that deletion is durable.

## Point lifecycle

Source rows and Context point mappings have separate lifecycles. Upsert known
keys after out-of-band or legacy inserts, existing-row backfills, or vector
changes; delete known keys after source deletion; and reconcile after bulk or
uncertain changes. Never follow a Context-backed `project.rows` write with
`upsert_points()`: that one row operation already completes or durably starts
the required point reconciliation.

For an out-of-band source write, commit the source-row transaction before
calling `upsert_points()` or `delete_points()`. The source database change and
dedicated Context point mutation are not one cross-system transaction. On an
ambiguous outcome, inspect point status and reconcile rather than assuming both
sides committed together.

Point upsert and delete may return either `PointMutationResponse` or
`ContextOperation`:

```python
from polygres import ContextOperation

# The transaction that inserted or updated these source rows has committed.
result = project.context.upsert_points(
    collection_id,
    ["doc-1", "doc-2"],
    idempotency_key="support-docs-upsert-42",
)

if isinstance(result, ContextOperation):
    result = project.context.wait_for_operation(result)
```

Inspect `get_point_status()` before resubmitting after a timeout. Use
`scroll_points()` only for administrative point mappings; it does not expose
vectors or source payloads. Treat its cursor as opaque.

## Choose retrieval

| Need | Method |
| --- | --- |
| Count matching points | `project.context.count()` |
| Aggregate a registered filter | `project.context.facets()` |
| Semantic similarity | `project.context.search()` |
| Group by a registered filter | `project.context.grouped_search()` |
| Semantic plus configured full text | `project.context.text_hybrid()` |
| Expand from a verified graph anchor, then rank | `project.context.graph_first()` |
| Retrieve semantic seeds, then add graph evidence | `project.context.vector_first()` |
| Fuse independent Context and graph rankings | `project.context.rank_fusion()` |
| Couple semantic, lexical, and graph candidate generation | `project.context.joint()` |
| Compare HNSW results with exact retrieval | `project.context.recall_check()` |

Count and facet requests accept the same registered-filter shape as dense
retrieval. Facet only on a registered filter key:

```python
tenant_filter = {
    "must": [{"key": "tenant_id", "match": authorized_tenant_id}],
}
matching = project.context.count("support_docs", filter=tenant_filter)
categories = project.context.facets(
    "support_docs",
    "category",
    filter=tenant_filter,
    limit=20,
)
```

Dense retrieval uses a collection UUID or exact name:

```python
response = project.context.search(
    "support_docs",
    query_embedding,
    vector_name="title_semantic",
    filter={
        "must": [
            {"key": "tenant_id", "match": authorized_tenant_id},
        ]
    },
    limit=10,
)
```

Every ranked Context method accepts optional `vector_name`. Omit it to use the
collection's `default_vector_name`; otherwise pass an exact vector name and
build the query embedding with that vector's model and dimensions. Count and
facets operate on collection points and do not select a vector.

Use `graph_first()` when a verified start entity defines the candidate
neighborhood. Use `vector_first()` when semantic candidates should supply graph
seeds. Use `rank_fusion()` for independent rankings. Use `joint()` when graph
expansion must introduce candidates before exact Context rescoring and final
fusion. A positive Joint lexical weight requires a non-blank query and a
configured text column.

Do not invent graph IDs. Resolve starts from trusted application data or prior
typed results. Bound Context candidates, graph depth, graph candidates,
traversal candidates, final results, elapsed time, and application token use.

## Authorization and result handling

Registered filters constrain retrieval but are not an authorization boundary.
Derive collection choice and tenant filter values from trusted authorization
context. Do not pass arbitrary client-supplied tenant filters directly to
Context retrieval.

Ranked Context responses are typed envelopes, not cursor pages. Preserve server
order, scores, warnings, nullable fields, request IDs, and `to_dict()` output.
Administrative collection, point-scroll, and operation listings use `Page` and
opaque cursors.

`project.context.rank_fusion()` runs independent late fusion.
`project.context.joint()` calls only `/context/hybrid/joint` and preserves its
semantic, lexical, and graph evidence, contribution breakdown, fusion metadata,
trace counts, graph-introduction flag, baseline rank, and rank lift. It is not
an alias for rank fusion or `project.hybrid.joint()`.
