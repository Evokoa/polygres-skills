# Graph modeling

Model only relationships that are explicit in verified data.

## Nodes

- Name each source table and the stable row ID column used by Runtime API
  results. A stable row ID is an existing durable value, not a generated guess.
- List display, filter, and provenance columns separately from the identifier.
- Reject invented row IDs, ambiguous tables, and missing columns.

## Relationships

For every edge, record the source node, target node, relationship source,
cardinality, and direction. Explain whether traversal is outgoing, incoming,
or both. Do not infer a relationship solely from similar names.

Set a bounded depth and a fan-out or candidate limit. State how cycles,
high-degree nodes, deleted rows, and duplicate paths are handled. Include the
maximum returned rows and the application token budget when graph evidence is
used for RAG.

## Lifecycle and validation

Specify the readiness evidence needed before application use and the events
that require a rebuild. Validate known one-hop paths, reverse direction,
missing nodes, cyclic paths, authorization exclusions, and bounded high-degree
nodes. Preserve node table, stable row ID, relationship, depth, and path as
provenance.
